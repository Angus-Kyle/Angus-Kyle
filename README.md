## Heirloom Spotlight

### What I did for my group in the game project "Heirloom" was some of the art present, and some coding. I was also able to write the script and get the script in the beginning of the game to work on a timer.

## ShapeGame

[ShapeGame project](https://github.com/Angus-Kyle/Angus-Kyle/blob/main/Shapegame.zip)

### What I had done for my shape game is referenced it to a game series that I play often, called the Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise of video games.

#### Of course there are still some bugs to get fixed, but I like what I have done with it.
